Beating Up Zombies:
ZombieActor class will be given a new attribute "Limbs" which will contain instances of new "Arm" & "Leg" classes, which will extend WeaponItem. These limbs can not however, be used as weapons until dropped, as they will be in the list "Limbs" and not "Inventory". The Zombie class will overide the Actor class's hurt() method. The new hurt() will do the same as the original and have a 25% chance of calling the new method "knockOffLimb()" which will be a private method in the Zombie class, and will check if there are still limbs on the zombie and if there is, will knock one off at random and drop it on the ground at the location of the zombie. A message will be displayed to tell the player. As they are WeaponItem objects, the dropped limbs can then be picked up and used as weapons.

Whenever a zombie's getWeapon() is called, it will check how many arms are left in the Limbs array and multiply 25% by the number of arms. This will result in a 50%, 25% and 0% chance of of using the normal attack if there are 2, 1, and 0 arms respectively. After chosing the attack, it will also drop any weapon if number of arms is 0, and have a 50% chance of dropping its weapon if number of arms is 1. The weapon will be removed from the inventory using removeItemFromInventory and dropped on the ground using Location's addItem().

A new private boolean attribute will be added to the zombie class called "canMoveThisTurn". Getters and setters will be made for this attribute. A getter will be made for getting the number of limbs on the zombie. Both the hunt and wander behaviour will be modified to check the number of legs on the zombie before moving it. If the number of legs is one and the canMoveThisTurn attribute is true, the zombie can move and canMoveThisTurn will be set to false. On the other hand, if canMoveThisTurn is false at the start of the turn, the zombie will not move that turn and will set canMoveThisTurn to true. If the zombie has no legs, canMoveThisTurn is disregarded, and the zombie will not move.
