Crafting Weapons:
A new class called CraftAction (which extends Action) will be created, which, given an craftable weapon and a reference to an actor, stores an action to craft it into a new item and put it in the actor's inventory, and remove the old item. To add this option to an actor's allowable actions, all craftable items will implement a new interface called Craftable. Craftable will have an interface method called addCraftableAction, which will be implemented in all objects that implement it, to create the item's CraftAction and add it to the item's allowableActions attribute. This attribute is scanned on every turn and so will automatically appear in the menu for the player to choose. In the case of limbs, they will be crafted into the ZombieMace or ZombieClub, which will be two new subclasses of WeaponItem.
