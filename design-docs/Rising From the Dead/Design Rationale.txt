Rising from the Dead:
A new class will be created called "Corpse" which will extend PortableItem and in addition to a name and display symbol, its construtor will also take ZombieCapability, so it knows if it is a dead human or zombie, and a GameMap, so actors and locations can be accessed. 

I chose to create this new class as a subclass of PortableItem so corpses could still be a PortableItem but also add extra functionality for changing into a Zombie.

AttackAction will be modified to drop dead actors as Corpse objects instead of PortableItems. 

The Corpse class will override the Item class's tick() method and will have an integer attribute called riseIn. riseIn will be set to a random integer between 5-10 in the Corpse constructor. The tick() method gets run on every turn by the GameMap class, and so riseIn will be used to count the number of turns passed since the actor died.

Each time tick() is called by GameMap (after every turn), it will check if the corpse is a human corpse. This is because other corpses (such as zombie corpes) shouldn't rise. If it is human it will check if riseIn = 0. If it doesn't it will subtract 1 from riseIn. If it does, it will call another method in Corpse called riseFromTheDead().

riseFromTheDead() will create a new zombie object, place it in the location of the Corpse object and remove itself from the ground, if it is still on the ground. To find it's position, it will loop through all locations in it's GameMap attribute. However, as corpses inherit from PortableItem, they can be picked up and so may be in an actor's inventory.

If the corpse is in an inventory, it will make a new zombie object in a random free space adjacent to the actor who is holding the corpse (using GameMap.locationOf(actor).getExits to find the adjacent spaces, and then Location.canActorEnter(actor) to see which spaces an new actor can be placed on). Then it will remove itself from the actor's inventory. 

If there are no free spaces adjacent to the actor, nothing will happen and it will try riseFromTheDead() on the next tick(), as the Corpse object will still exist and riseIn will still be 0. 

If the corpse successfully rose, a message will be displayed to the player, such as "A corpse rose from the dead".
