Rising from the Dead:
A new class will be created called "Corpse" which will extend PortableItem and in addition to a name and display symbol, its construtor will also take ZombieCapability, so it knows if it is a dead human or zombie, and a GameMap, so actors and locations can be accessed. AttackAction will be modified to drop dead actors as Corpse objects instead of PortableItems. The Corpse class will override the Item class's tick() method and will have an integer attribute called riseIn. riseIn will be set to a random integer between 5-10 in the Corpse constructor. Each time tick() is called by GameMap (after every turn), it will check if the corpse is a human corpse. If it is it will check if riseIn = 0. If it doesn't it will subtract 1 from riseIn. If it does, it will call another method in Corpse called riseFromTheDead(), which will create a new zombie object, place it in the location of the Corpse object and remove itself from the ground, if it is still on the ground. If the corpse is in an inventory, it will make a new zombie object in a random free space adjacent to the actor who is holding the corpse (using GameMap.locationOf(actor).getExits, and then Location.canActorEnter(actor)), then remove itself from the actor's inventory. If there are no free spaces adjacent to the actor, nothing will happen and it will try riseFromTheDead() on the next tick(). If the corpse successfully rose, a message will be displayed to the player.
